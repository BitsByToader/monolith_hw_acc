# Getting started
NOTE: This project was created using Vivado 2024.2 on a Linux machine. Might not work in other environments.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Change the working directory to work\_dir/.
3. Launch Vivado. Vivado should always be launched from here, as to not pollute other dirs with logs or dumps.
4. Source rebuild\_proj.ctl script. A .xpr project should be created in this directory.
5. Launch simulations, synthesis, etc.
